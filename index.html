            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                The Department was founded as the Mathematical Laboratory under the leadership of John Lennard-Jones on 14 May 1937, though it did not get properly established until after World War II. The new laboratory was housed in the North Wing of the former Anatomy School, on the New Museums Site. Upon its foundation, it was intended "to provide a computing service for general use, and to be a centre for the development of computational techniques in the University". The Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science was the world's first postgraduate taught course in computing, starting in 1953.

                In October 1946, work began under Maurice Wilkes on EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator), which subsequently became the world's first fully operational and practical stored program computer when it ran its first program on 6 May 1949. It inspired the world's first business computer, LEO. It was replaced by EDSAC 2, the first microcoded and bitsliced computer, in 1958.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Global excellence and local relevance in research, teaching, and
                technology development is the vision of the Department. The Department was started as the Computer
                Centre in 1973 with the acquisition of an IBM 370, perhaps the most powerful computer in India at that
                time. It offered M.Tech, M.S and PhD degree programmes. In 1983, the B.Tech degree programme was
                started.
                Today the Department has a vibrant student body numbering about 700. Over 60% are postgraduate, mostly
                supported by scholarships. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Welcome to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT
                Madras. IIT Madras was ranked first amongst several other similar Research and Teaching institutions in
                Engineering in the 2016 and 2017 National Institute Ranking Framework established by the Ministry for
                Human Resources Development (MHRD), the Government of India. IIT Madras was ranked amongst the top 50
                Asian Universities in the QS rankings 2018.
                The Department started as the Computer Centre in 1973 with the acquisition of an IBM 370 Computer. It
                presently offers B. Tech., dual-degree B.Tech./ M.Tech., M.Tech., M.S., Ph.D. degree programmes. A
                dual-degree B.Tech/M.Tech. program in data science, open to all B.Tech. students of IIT Madras, has been
                started from Jan. 2018.
